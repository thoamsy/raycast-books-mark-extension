# Raycast extension

- React 18
- no fetch directly, use `useFetch`, https://developers.raycast.com/utilities/react-hooks/usefetch
- useLocalStorage for storage, https://developers.raycast.com/utilities/react-hooks/uselocalstorage
- it's quite difference with standard web dev, no css
- use pnpm in favor of npm
